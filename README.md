# F1 Analytics
This repo is the home for **F1 Analytics** final team project that will house data, code, and related files for a project analyzing F1 data. 

## Project Summary
Formula 1 is the highest class of single-driver racing. There are 10 teams and 20 drivers (two drivers per team) that compete during a Formula 1 season, although there are occasionally driver substitutes if a driver is unavailable. In 2021, the Formula 1 season consisted of 22 races in 20 different countries. While the current scope of the project is still in discussion, we will be using data that is sourced from a (Kaggle dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=circuits.csv] and cleaned, munged, and visualized by this team. 

## Ideas
Some questions that we could answer (but haven't decided yet!) are:
- What makes Lewis Hamilton the most accomplished driver on the track today?
- Which constructor/team is showing the most promise going into the 2022 season?
- Who is the best driver on the circuit today?
- Which drivers are the most consistent producers of output?
